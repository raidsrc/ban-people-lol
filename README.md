# Ban People Lol

This is a little coding project I did for fun to give myself an excuse to do more web development. It's a simulated forum user list with a bunch of simulated users. You can view user info and ban users with the click of a button. You can unban them too, if you so choose. This project makes use of NextJS, MaterialUI, Next API Routes, SWR, and MongoDB Atlas. And probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. I originally used TailwindCSS but decided to switch to MaterialUI for the styling because I'd never used MUI before and wanted to learn how to use it.
